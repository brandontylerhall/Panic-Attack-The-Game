Panic Attack is a game about a person (hereby "MC") who has crippling social anxiety. 
MC goes for a walk into town to reflect on the day and clear their head. 
When MC returns, what they come to find is quite literally their biggest fear and nightmare: a party is being thrown at the house.
Help MC get to their room, escape the horrendous noise and obnoxious party-goers, and get some Zs.

This is entirely a passion project that I work on on my own time with no set timelines

Hopes for this project:
  1. Learn as much as I can
  2. Get it fully operational and playable
  3. Find out if I have an interest for game development
  4. After completion, develop the game further into a pixel art game with moving pieces and keyboard controls

    outside *** prologue/car part

js to implement:

    ✓✓✓ create a sort of credits screen at the beginning (intervalled to whatever) ✓✓✓
    opening shot/prologue: interval the text so it's like a scrolling type shit (function?)
    ✓✓✓ make button interface for speech ✓✓✓
    *** mayhaps *** store strings in JS instead of inside HTML

css/bootstrap to implement:

    ✓✓✓ recreate the ui in bootstrap ✓✓✓
    eventually figure out some scenery art and put that as the background-image on .text-container (MS paint lmfao/pixel art academy game)
    eventually figure out a better color scheme bc this shit is horrendous
    *** not actually css but y'know... *** jquery animations (mayhaps)
